# This workflow is run whenever a pull request is opened, re-opened, or taken
# out of draft (ready for review). 
#
# NOTE: pull_request_target behaves the same as pull_request except it gives a
# read/write token to workflows running on a pull request from a fork. While this 
# may seem unsafe, there is a repository rule setting set that requires approval from a maintainer 
# to run workflows for external contributors' pull requests. Those who approve workflow runs 
# must be looking through the workflow files attentively and ensuring there aren't any malicious 
# changes.
